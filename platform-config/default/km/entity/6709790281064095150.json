      "markdown": "## The Birth of Finance\n\nWelcome to the Financial District, or as the locals like to call it, FiDi! This is the historic birthplace of global finance, so it\u0027s not surprising that this vibrant neighborhood exudes ambition and energy. The Financial District encompasses roughly the area south of City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan but excludes Battery Park and Battery Park City. One can easily spend a full day wandering through its iconic landmarks.\n\nThe most famous landmark in this area is One World Trade Center, which stands tall and proud at 1,776 feet. It\u0027s an excellent starting point for your visit to FiDi since you\u0027ll get a fantastic view of Manhattan from the observation deck on its 102nd floor. From there venture onwards to Trinity Church- another prominent landmark in FiDi- where Alexander Hamilton is buried. Incidentally, he was one of America\u0027s founding fathers who had a significant impact on our financial system.\n\n## Skyscrapers and Statues\n\nAs you walk around FiDi taking in all its attractions, do keep an eye out for various statues that commemorate important figures from history. There are several notable ones throughout this neighborhood with \u0027Charging Bull\u0027 being one that tourists always seem drawn too.\n\nBut you can\u0027t miss The National 9/11 Memorial \u0026 Museum - it lies within Ground Zero and pays homage to victims who lost their lives during September 11th terror attacks emphasizing how determined New York was in getting back up on their feet after such tremendous loss. \r\n\r\n## The bustling streets\r\n\r\nFiDi has some great dining options for both lunch and dinner - perfect since you\u0027re going probably going to be exhausted after walking around all day!\n\nEl Vez promises great Mexican fare including classic items such as tacos alongside grilled fish plates too while Burrito Bar will leave your mouth watering with savory meat wrapped delicately inside warm tortillas.\r\n\r\nIf French cuisine is more your thing then Racines should be next on your list - it\u0027s a delightful little place that serves up French classics such as escargot and steak-frites\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least; Augustine is an American Brasserie featuring cozy interiors, and warm lighting to create the perfect atmosphere for dinner. Believe it or not- some of the menu items have been inspired by classic dishes such as steaks from Manhattan\u0027s old Four Seasons Restaurant!\r\n\r\nFiDi is dense with office buildings and workers continually traversing through these streets and, of course, tourists soaking in all of its landmarks. So beware of large crowds!\n\n## Dining in the district \r\n\r\nNew York\u0027s Financial District has a rich history revolving around finance stretching back centuries ago but when you visit today - what will catch your eye most are its skyscrapers. As much as they symbolize modern America, New Yorkers also cling to traditions, making this neighborhood diverse as it is exciting.\r\n\r\nSo go ahead- take a walk down Wall Street and Broad Street; immerse yourself into this vibrant cityscape which speaks volumes about who we are today!"

The former World Trade Center complex was located in the neighborhood until the September 11, 2001, attacks; the neighborhood includes the successor One World Trade Center. The heart of the Financial District is often considered to be the corner of Wall Street and Broad Street, both of which are contained entirely within the district.[13] The northeastern part of the Financial District (along Fulton Street and John Street) was known in the early 20th century as the Insurance District, due to the large number of insurance companies that were either headquartered there, or maintained their New York offices there.",
